# Object Models in Ruby and Javascript

this talk aims to explore how objects are implemented in Ruby and Javascript. by comparing and contrasting these two models, i hope to demonstrate that these models are fundamentally very similar. however, insofar as they differ, those differences can be used to explain the maturity difference in application design patterns between the two languages.

## Plan

1. Object Fundamentals
	a. Javascript Object Literals
	b. Ruby Objects
	c. Ruby Classes
	d. Data Encapsulation in Ruby

2. Object Creation
	a. Javascript
		i. Object Literals
		ii. Contructor Patterm
			- new
			- this
			- prototype property
	b. Ruby
		i. constructors and the new method
		ii. classes are objects

3. Javascript - Prototypal Inheritence

4. Ruby - Classical Inheritence and dispatch
